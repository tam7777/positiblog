# positiblog

This is a simple blog that I have created using Django and relatively small LLM (mainly because it is cheap compared to new ones such as gpt4).
This  is the over all view

When someone comments, small LLM such as roberta or distilled bert or gpt2 will also comment. Negative comments on a post will get deleted instantly.
