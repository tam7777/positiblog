# positiblog

This is a simple blog that I have created using Django and relatively small LLM (mainly because it is cheap compared to new ones such as gpt4).
This  is the over all view

When someone comments, multiple LLM such as roberta or distilled bert or gpt2 will also comment. Negative comments on a post will get deleted instantly inclusing the ones which LLM's has commented.

When running this server on a local laptop, commenting might take quite a while, since six LLMs are running everytime someone comments.
