# positiblog

This is a simple blog that I have created using Django and relatively small LLM, such as roberta or distilled bert or gpt2 etc... (mainly because it is cheap compared to new ones such as gpt4).

When someone comments, multiple LLM will also comment. Negative comments on a post will get deleted instantly inclusing the ones which LLM's has commented.

When running this server on a local laptop, commenting might take quite a while, since six LLMs are running everytime someone comments.
